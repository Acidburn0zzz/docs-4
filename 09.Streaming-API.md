# Streaming API

**Use the streaming API to listen to messsages, events and changes in rooms.** The streaming API allows real-time access to rooms. Unlike other APIs, all requests to the streaming API should be made to *stream.gitter.im*. Authentication is identical to [the REST API Authentication](authentication).

## Connecting

To connect to the Streaming API, form a HTTP request and consume the resulting stream for as long as is practical. The Gitter servers will hold the connection open indefinitely (barring a server-side error, excessive client-side lag, network hiccups or routine server maintenance). If the server returns an unexpected response code, clients should a wait few seconds before trying again.

Try it from the CLI:
```
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer {{token}}" "{{stream_url}}/v1/rooms/:roomId/chatMessages"
```

## Content Types

The streaming API supports JSON stream content type.

Content is encoded as UTF-8.

### JSON Stream (`application/json`)

The JSON stream returns messages as JSON objects that are delimited by carriage return (`\r`). Newline characters (`\n`) may occur in messages, but carriage returns should not.

Parsers must be tolerant of occasional extra newline characters placed between messages. These characters are sent as periodic "keep-alive" messages to tell clients and NAT firewalls that the connection is still alive during low message volume periods.

## Resources

### GET /v1/rooms/:roomId/:resource

Returns all messages from the specified Room.

## Ruby Example

    require 'eventmachine'
    require 'em-http'
    require 'json'

    # token = your Gitter access token
    # room_id = the Room ID

    http = EM::HttpRequest.new(
      "https://stream.gitter.im/v1/rooms/#{room_id}/chatMessages",
      :keepalive => true, :connect_timeout => 0, :inactivity_timeout => 0)
    EventMachine.run do
      s = http.get(:head => { 'Authorization' => "Bearer #{token}", 'accept' => 'application/json'})

      buffer = ""
      s.stream do |chunk|
        buffer << chunk
        while line = buffer.slice!(/.+\r\n/)
          puts JSON.parse(line).inspect
        end
      end
    end
