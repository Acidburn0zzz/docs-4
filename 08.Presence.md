# Presence API

**Please note that this is preliminary documentation and is subject to change**

**Use the presence API to publish client presence state information.**. It is strongly coupled to the Faye streaming API and clients cannot signal presence without using the Faye streaming API.

### Presence Concepts

**`clientId`**: This is the clientId used by the Faye streaming API client connection. It is returned in as the `clientId` attribute after a Faye `handshake` message. The `clientId` is used as a way to reference a single client, e.g. a single browser tab as opposed to all the tabs open by a single user. 

**Eyeballs**: this refers literally to the user's _eyeballs_ in relation to the Gitter applications. When Gitter is the foremost application or browser tab, the user is _eyeballs on_, otherwise the user is _eyeballs off_. Even if the application is in the foreground, but the user does not move the mouse or touch the keyboard for a minute, the application should signal that the user is _eyeballs off_, and the signal _eyeballs on_ when the user interacts with their desktop once again.


## Sending Notification Signals

When the user's eyeballs state changes, the client should signal the server using a POST:

`POST /api/v1/eyeballs`

The POST body should contain two variables:
  
  * `socketId`: the Faye `clientId` for this client.
  * `on`: value 1 indicates _eyeballs on_, 0 indicates _eyeballs off_.


Example:

```
$ curl -vi  -d socketId=cafe3733babe -d on=1 https://api.gitter.im/v1/eyeballs?access_token={{token}}
```

## Obtaining notification signals for all users in a room

Presence messages are available in the room's root channel at:

`/api/v1/rooms/:roomId`

Presence messages take the form:

```
{
  notification: "presence",
  userId: userId,
  status: "in" or "out"
}
```
